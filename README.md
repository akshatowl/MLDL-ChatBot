Chatbot with embeddings

## Tech stack used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase for database  

## Running the script  

Make sure you have **node** dependencies installed in order to run the local server. In  your terminal run the following:  

```
npm install node
```

This installs Node.Js dependencies. We do not use Node.js for our backend logic. Node.js is needed to start a local host which we have set up in the file **server.js**.  

Start a server instance. In the terminal run:

```
node server.js
```

## Dependencies

- Express.js
- Express JSON
- JSON
- Java Swing UI
- CORS
- MongoClient (to connect with mongodb)
- Firebase client (to connect with firebase)

  ```
  npm install node
  npm install express
  ```

If everything is setup properly, the localhost link should direct the user to the homepage.
